rough align.
e 2s ? - exposure
capture black frames 10 or so
remove cap
g 0.5 or so
d 1 - subtract median
use up/down to find some stars
focus
mt 1 - enable tracking
z 1 - find stars
zb - begin list
10 frames or so
ze - end list
mae 36000 - move east 10 degrees
zb - begin list
10 frames or so
ze - end list
zl - show star lists. should be 2 similar lists
zc - center of mount axis
copy numbers to safe place. let's say they are:
calculateCenter WindowThread calculated center is 443.622,479.047 angle: -7844.65" error: 0.898061 px
zd 0 - delete list 0
mt 0 - disable tracking
wait 2-4 minutes
mt 1 - enable tracking
zb - begin list
10 frames or so
ze - end list
zl - show star lists. should be 2.
zc - center of celestial sphere
copy numbers to safe place. let's say they are:
calculateCenter WindowThread calculated center is 371.626,4334.52 angle: -3666.69" error: 1.15879 px
adjust the mount left/right.
in this case the mount center is +443 pixels and the celestial center is +373 pixels.
so we need move the mount to the left by 443-373=70 pixels.
zl - show star list
zb - begin list
10 frames
ze - end list
zl - show star lists
the star lists should differ by about 70 pixels in x.
if not then delete that list zd 1, try again.
adjust the mount up/down
in this case we need to move down 4434-479=3955 pixels.
which is a lot.
the screen is 1000 pixels tall.
maybe estimate 1/4 turn is x pixels.
find more stars.
repeat the adjustments until perfect.
it's acceptable to slew east or west to find suitable stars.

when satisfied or frustrated.
mae 252000 - 70 degrees
t poles#.tif - auto save images.
save 10 frames
t - pause auto save
maw 36000 - 10 degrees
repeat until at +80 degrees or the mount won't move.

capture stars on the right.
mz - zero poisition
mas 1000 - slew until right side stars are now on the left.
maw xxx - until scope is more/less pointed up with no left or right.
repeat captures.
slew 10 degrees east until 90 degrees right
capture stars on the left.
mz - zero position
man xxx - same amount you slewed to move stars above
repeat captures and slews until 90 degrees left
