conversions:
1' = 60"
1* = 3,600"
1s = 15'
1m = 900'
1h = 54,000'

rough align.
e 2s ? - exposure
capture black frames 10 or so
remove cap
g 0.5 or so
d 1 - subtract median
z 1 - find stars
use up/down to find some stars
mt 1 - enable tracking
focus

method 2.
enable tracking.
slew south 10s of degrees.
the scope should be pointed east-ish.
watch stars.
if they are not moving left/right much make a list.
wait.
if the stars move left then move the mount down.
if the stars move right then move the mount up.
about a quarter turn.
repeat the up/down adjustments until satisfied or bored.
slew west 80 degrees.
the scope should be pointed up-ish.
watch stars.
if they are not moving left/right much make a list.
wait.
if the stars move left then move the mount right.
if the stars move right then move the mount left.
repeat the left/right adjustments until satisfied or bored.
repeat up/down and left/right until satisfied or bored.


better align. requires patience.
zb - begin list
10 frames or so
ze - end list
mt 0 - disable tracking.
at this point the reliable stars should be blue circles.
and the found stars should be red circles.
wait until stars move out of the blue circles.
adjust mount.
if stars are going left - move mount down.
if stars are going right - move mount up.
if stars are going up - move mount left.
if stars are going down - move mount right.
zd
repeat until stars are going around the center of the screen.
there are 3 or so magnitude <11 with 9 minutes of celestial center.
540 arc seconds.
so might be able to get them in the field of view.

once close to polar aligned,
maybe align to SAO 3788 mag 9.69 at 18h 32m 45.1s +89° 51' 00.0"
9' over the top = 540"
tonight it will be close left of celestial pole.
there's another star that is relatively close.
TYC 4661-22-1 Magnitude 11.06 Ra/Dec 20h 07m 08.1s +89° 42' 42.4"
halfway between them would be: 19h 19.5m 26.6s 89* 46' 51.2"
which is about 789" over the top.

another trio is:
TYC 4627-64-1 Magnitude 11.00 Ra/Dec 03h 24m 55.4s +89° 51' 03.9"
Gaia DR2 576450032065053568 Magnitude 11.56 Ra/Dec 02h 04m 45.1s +89° 48' 08.7"
SAO 49 Magnitude 10.50 Ra/Dec 00h 57m 24.7s +89° 48' 45.0"
center would be: 1h 69m 1.733s 89* 49' 19.2"
which is about 641" south 5 hours west = 270,000"
tonight it will be close to straight up.

there's a cluster of stars tonight about 29'=1710" 6h 30m east of pole.
4 maybe 5 stars.

need a goto command.
it needs to accept degrees, hms, d'" formats.

need to track the motion of reliable stars over time.
reset it when we slew.


mae 36000 - move east 10 degrees
zb - begin list
10 frames or so
ze - end list
zl - show star lists. should be 2 similar lists
zc - center of mount axis
copy numbers to safe place. let's say they are:
calculateCenter WindowThread calculated center is 443.622,479.047 angle: -7844.65" error: 0.898061 px
zd 0 - delete list 0
mt 0 - disable tracking
wait 2-4 minutes
mt 1 - enable tracking
zb - begin list
10 frames or so
ze - end list
zl - show star lists. should be 2.
zc - center of celestial sphere
copy numbers to safe place. let's say they are:
calculateCenter WindowThread calculated center is 371.626,4334.52 angle: -3666.69" error: 1.15879 px
adjust the mount left/right.
in this case the mount center is +443 pixels and the celestial center is +373 pixels.
so we need move the mount to the left by 443-373=70 pixels.
zl - show star list
zb - begin list
10 frames
ze - end list
zl - show star lists
the star lists should differ by about 70 pixels in x.
if not then delete that list zd 1, try again.
adjust the mount up/down
in this case we need to move down 4434-479=3955 pixels.
which is a lot.
the screen is 1000 pixels tall.
maybe estimate 1/4 turn is x pixels.
find more stars.
repeat the adjustments until perfect.
it's acceptable to slew east or west to find suitable stars.

when satisfied or frustrated.
mae 252000 - 70 degrees
t poles#.tif - auto save images.
save 10 frames
t - pause auto save
maw 36000 - 10 degrees
repeat until at +80 degrees or the mount won't move.

capture stars on the right.
mz - zero poisition
mas 1000 - slew until right side stars are now on the left.
maw xxx - until scope is more/less pointed up with no left or right.
repeat captures.
slew 10 degrees east until 90 degrees right
capture stars on the left.
mz - zero position
man xxx - same amount you slewed to move stars above
repeat captures and slews until 90 degrees left
