collimation procedure

1. center the small secondary mirror.
use a small ruler that fits inside the tube.
the distance from tube to outer diameter of the base is about 48 mm.

2. align the secondary mirror.
loosen the three tiny screws on the secondary mirror base.
look through the focuser tube.
use a medium screwdriver to position the secondary mirror.
get a friend to tighten the tiny screws.
1/8 turn at a time.

3. align the focuser tube using shims.
repeat steps 2,3 as needed or until frustrated.

4. strap the scope into its cradle.
clamp it to a table.
place the artificial star field about 20' away.
attach camera with all 4 spacers.
fully extend the focuser.
remove cover.

5. run the zwo code.
exposure (e) about 10,000 us.
iso (1) about 2000.
show the collimation circles (k).
shift the cradle until a star is in view.
adjust focus so it's about 60% of the window height.

5. adjust the primary mirror so the shadow of the secondary mirror is centered.
there are three pairs of medium screws.
the right screw threads with the tube.
the left screw threads with the mirrror.
loosen one. tighten the other.
use your finger or screwdriver handle to determine which set to adjust.

6. to "lift" the mirror - loosen left, tighten right.
if the shadow is too far left then you need to lift the right.
usually you go in small increments.
but for the first time i do 1-2 complete turns to ensure this is the correct direction.
adjusting the mirror will move the star out of the field of view.
shift the cradle to the same or different star.
repeat with small steps. usually 1/4 turn.
repeat with a different pair of adjustment screws.
repeat until satisifed or frustrated.
